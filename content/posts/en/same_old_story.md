I don't think I even remember anymore, how many times I have restarted the blog. Last time I wrote something useful, was probably around 2008. 

I still have the old sites backed up somewhere. At least few of them. Unfortunately they're not very useful, mostly because they have been using blogging engines -- either Wordpress-like, or my own -- and while I backed up the code, I did not export anything from the database, leaving myself with just the looks, and no content.

In 2017 I have discovered [Static Site Generators](https://gohugo.io/), and it changed my approach completely. Primarily, because engines, blogging engines, and Wordpress above anything else, are just one big [honeypots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)). The fact that I didn't have to spin up any MySQL instance and therefore hosting costs dropped to big fat zero, after introduction of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) was a big plus, but the biggest benefit of them all is the fact, that I have a full, working and accessible copy of my blog. If only I continued to write :)

I hope, this time will truly be better :)
